#Assignment: Perform an RNA-seq analysis

For this assignment, I used RNA-seq data from Drosophila melanogaster, from an experiment (PRJNA604807) done in February of this year by Carl Thummel of the University of Utah.
The group looked at the Drosophila Estrogen-Related Receptor (dERR) and how knocking it out changes the metabolic response of 6 day old pupae.

By using the code below, I aligned the sample sequences to the Drosophila genome, used featurecounts to find the transcript counts that overlap annotations, and used DESeq to find the
differentially expressed transcripts. When I passed them through a filter of a p-value less than 0.05, and then sorted for highest foldchange, I found the following transcripts to have the highest
differential expression between control and knockout. There were 879 DEGs in all.

exon-NR_123930.1-1	27.7818736869891
exon-NM_001043089.3-1	16.0129186111418
exon-NM_170263.4-1	15.9646944331902
exon-NM_130725.3-1	11.6948365106152
exon-NR_124559.1-4	11.3554174922804
exon-NR_133288.1-1	8.97618102175957
exon-NM_001260053.1-1	8.88252405923184
exon-NM_132187.3-1	8.33487276991195
exon-NM_141629.3-2	8.06567747978057
exon-NM_001260053.1-2	8.03916588639734

I then tried to perform a GSEA on the DEGs that I found, but I had a very hard time with converting these RefSeq IDs into genes or finding anything else about these IDs. I got the GFF file from the NCBI,
so if I had more time I would have tried a different annotation file but the assignment was late anyway. The authors found that "glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathway genes are induced by dERR",
so at least there is some knowledge about the gene- and protein-level changes when dERR is knocked out. They also report that the flies have decreased locomotion, are susceptible to starvartion, and
and seem to be putting all of their glucose in the bloodstream vs storing it via triglycerides.
